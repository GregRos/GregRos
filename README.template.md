Hi! I’m Greg.

I build things, and I love having the perfect tools to build things with. So if I need a tool that doesn’t exist, I’ll just make it myself.

This profile is a collection of these tools, assembled over 15 years or so. I like to divide the projects here into a few categories:

- **[Packages][category,packages]:** Working, tested, and documented; you can use these yourself.
- **[Personal][category,personal]:** Working but undocumented; mileage may vary.
- **[Incomplete][category,incomplete]:** Packages that didn’t get where I wanted them to.
- **[Obsolete][category,obsolete]:** I consider them irrelevant.
- **[Sample][category,sample]:** A bit of code in various languages.

You’ll find a pretty wide range of domains and technologies. Here are some major groupings:

[Library][type,library] ┇ [Framework][type,framework] ┇ [Tool][type,tool] ┇ [Hotkeys][type,hotkeys] ┇ [TypeScript][lang,typescript] ┇ [Python][lang,python] ┇ [.NET][lang,dotnet] ┇ [C#][lang,csharp] ┇ [F#][lang,fsharp] ┇ [Rust][lang,rust] ┇ [Scala][lang,scala] ┇ [bash][lang,bash] ┇ [Kubernetes][tech,k8s] ┇ [vscode][tech,vscode] ┇ [Parsing][domain,parsing] ┇ [Modding][domain,modding] ┇ [Printing][domain,print] ┇ [Testing][domain,testing] ┇ [Scripting][domain,scripting] ┇ [Data Binding][domain,data-binding]

----

Even if a project has been dormant for years, I'll often come back to it. The languages, technologies, and domains I work with tend to change based on stuff I'm doing in real life.

- I used to mainly do C# and F#, so that's what most of my old stuff is. 
- My newer stuff is either TypeScript or Python.

I've written in over 30 languages in around 25 years of programming, so you'll find tons of other stuff here too.
