Hi! I’m Greg.

I build things, and I love having the perfect tools to build things with. So if I need a tool that doesn’t exist, I’ll just make it myself.

This profile is a collection of these tools, assembled over 15 years or so. I like to divide the projects here into a few categories:

**[📦 Packages][category,packages]**
Tested, and documented; you can use these yourself.

**[🤗 Personal][category,personal]**
Working but undocumented; mileage may vary.

**[🧩 Incomplete][category,incomplete]**
Not quite there yet.

**[🗑️ Obsolete][category,obsolete]**
No longer relevant.

**[🦠 Sample][category,sample]**
It's just some code that runs.

I've built stuff across a wide range of techs and domains:

**Type**
[Library][type,library]  ∙  [Framework][type,framework]  ∙  [Tool][type,tool]  ∙  [Hotkeys][type,hotkeys]

**Language**
[TypeScript][lang,typescript]  ∙  [Python][lang,python]  ∙  [.NET][lang,dotnet]  ∙  [C#][lang,csharp]  ∙  [F#][lang,fsharp]  ∙  [Rust][lang,rust]  ∙  [Scala][lang,scala]  ∙  [bash][lang,bash]

**Tech**
[Kubernetes][tech,k8s]  ∙  [vscode][tech,vscode]

**Domain**
[Parsing][domain,parsing]  ∙  [Modding][domain,modding]  ∙  [Printing][domain,print]  ∙  [Testing][domain,testing]  ∙  [Scripting][domain,scripting]  ∙  [Data Binding][domain,data-binding]

Even if a project has been dormant for years, I'll often come back to it.
