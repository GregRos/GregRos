Hi! I’m Greg.

I build things, and I love having the perfect tools to build things with. So if I need a tool that doesn’t exist, I’ll just make it myself.

This profile is a collection of these tools, assembled over 15 years or so. I like to divide the projects here into a few categories:

- **[Packages](https://github.com/GregRos?tab=repositories&q=topic:package):** Working, tested, and documented; you can use these yourself.
- **[Personal](https://github.com/GregRos?tab=repositories&q=topic:personal):** Working but undocumented; mileage may vary.
- **[Incomplete](https://github.com/GregRos?tab=repositories&q=topic:incomplete+topic:package+-topic:obsolete):** Packages that didn’t get where I wanted them to.
- **[Obsolete](https://github.com/GregRos?tab=repositories&q=topic:obsolete):** I consider them irrelevant.
- **[Sample](https://github.com/GregRos?tab=repositories&q=topic:sample):** A bit of code in various languages.

You’ll find a pretty wide range of domains and technologies. Here are some major groupings:

[Library](https://github.com/GregRos?tab=repositories&q=topic:library+-topic:obsolete+-topic:incomplete+topic:package) ┇ [Framework](https://github.com/GregRos?tab=repositories&q=topic:framework+-topic:obsolete+-topic:incomplete+topic:package) ┇ [Tool](https://github.com/GregRos?tab=repositories&q=topic:tool) ┇ [Hotkeys](https://github.com/GregRos?tab=repositories&q=topic:hotkeys) ┇ [TypeScript](https://github.com/GregRos?tab=repositories&q=topic:typescript+-topic:obsolete+-topic:incomplete+topic:package) ┇ [Python](https://github.com/GregRos?tab=repositories&q=topic:python) ┇ [.NET](https://github.com/GregRos?tab=repositories&q=topic:dotnet) ┇ [C#](https://github.com/GregRos?tab=repositories&q=topic:csharp) ┇ [F#](https://github.com/GregRos?tab=repositories&q=topic:fsharp) ┇ [Rust](https://github.com/GregRos?tab=repositories&q=topic:rust) ┇ [Scala](https://github.com/GregRos?tab=repositories&q=topic:scala) ┇ [bash](https://github.com/GregRos?tab=repositories&q=topic:bash) ┇ [Kubernetes](https://github.com/GregRos?tab=repositories&q=topic:kubernetes+-topic:obsolete) ┇ [vscode](https://github.com/GregRos?tab=repositories&q=topic:vscode+-topic:obsolete) ┇ [Parsing](https://github.com/GregRos?tab=repositories&q=topic:parsing+-topic:obsolete) ┇ [Modding](https://github.com/GregRos?tab=repositories&q=topic:modding+-topic:obsolete) ┇ [Printing](https://github.com/GregRos?tab=repositories&q=topic:print+-topic:obsolete) ┇ [Testing](https://github.com/GregRos?tab=repositories&q=topic:testing+-topic:obsolete) ┇ [Scripting](https://github.com/GregRos?tab=repositories&q=topic:scripting+-topic:obsolete) ┇ [Data Binding](https://github.com/GregRos?tab=repositories&q=topic:data-binding+-topic:obsolete)

----

Even if a project has been dormant for years, I'll often come back to it. The languages, technologies, and domains I work with tend to change based on stuff I'm doing in real life.

- I used to mainly do C# and F#, so that's what most of my old stuff is. 
- My newer stuff is either TypeScript or Python.

I've written in over 30 languages in around 25 years of programming, so you'll find tons of other stuff here too.
